#### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Deprecated | Description | Example |
|-----------|:--------:|:----------:|-------------|--------|
| `Assets` | ✓ | ✗ | Provide the assets for photo editor | `V1AiPhotoEditorCreateBodyAssets {ImageFilePath: "api-assets/id/1234.png",}` |
| `└─ ImageFilePath` | ✓ | — | The image used to generate the output. This value is either - a direct URL to the video file - `file_path` field from the response of the [upload urls API](https://docs.magichour.ai/api-reference/files/generate-asset-upload-urls).  Please refer to the [Input File documentation](https://docs.magichour.ai/api-reference/files/generate-asset-upload-urls#input-file) to learn more.  | `"api-assets/id/1234.png"` |
| `Resolution` | ✓ | ✗ | The resolution of the final output image. The allowed value is based on your subscription. Please refer to our [pricing page](https://magichour.ai/pricing) for more details | `768` |
| `Style` | ✓ | ✗ |  | `V1AiPhotoEditorCreateBodyStyle {ImageDescription: "A photo of a person",LikenessStrength: 5.2,NegativePrompt: nullable.NewValue("painting, cartoon, sketch"),Prompt: "A photo portrait of a person wearing a hat",PromptStrength: 3.75,Steps: nullable.NewValue(4),UpscaleFactor: nullable.NewValue(2),UpscaleFidelity: nullable.NewValue(0.5),}` |
| `└─ ImageDescription` | ✓ | — | Use this to describe what your input image is. This helps maintain aspects of the image you don't want to change. | `"A photo of a person"` |
| `└─ LikenessStrength` | ✓ | — | Determines the input image's influence. Higher values align the output more with the initial image. | `5.2` |
| `└─ NegativePrompt` | ✗ | — | What you want to avoid seeing in the final output; has a minor effect. | `"painting, cartoon, sketch"` |
| `└─ Prompt` | ✓ | — | What you want your final output to look like. We recommend starting with the image description and making minor edits for best results. | `"A photo portrait of a person wearing a hat"` |
| `└─ PromptStrength` | ✓ | — | Determines the prompt's influence. Higher values align the output more with the prompt. | `3.75` |
| `└─ Steps` | ✗ | — | Number of iterations used to generate the output. Higher values improve quality and increase the strength of the prompt but increase processing time. | `4` |
| `└─ UpscaleFactor` | ✗ | — | The multiplier applied to an image's original dimensions during the upscaling process. For example, a scale of 2 doubles the width and height (e.g., from 512x512 to 1024x1024). | `2` |
| `└─ UpscaleFidelity` | ✗ | — | Upscale fidelity refers to the level of quality desired in the generated image. Fidelity value of 1 means more details. | `0.5` |
| `Name` | ✗ | ✗ | The name of image. This value is mainly used for your own identification of the image. | `"Photo Editor image"` |
| `Steps` | ✗ | ✓ | Deprecated: Please use `.style.steps` instead. Number of iterations used to generate the output. Higher values improve quality and increase the strength of the prompt but increase processing time. | `123` |
